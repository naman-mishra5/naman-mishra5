                <p>I have completed my Master of Arts in Economics degree from FS University, Shikohabad. My aim in life is to expand the horizon of my knowledge by contributing to the society while working in a collaborative and corporative environment, and by giving my best in every field and every situation I am put into. My keen interest lies in conducting research in the field of Economics, particularly in exploring its intersections with various facets of everyday life, such as the transformative impact of Industry 4.0, the dynamics of healthcare systems, and the critical importance of environmental sustainability.
